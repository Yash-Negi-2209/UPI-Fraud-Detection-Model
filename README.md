# UPI Fraud Transaction Detection
## Overview
This project aims to build an effective and efficient model for detecting fraudulent transactions in UPI payment systems. Fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial systems, and this project addresses it by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The project incorporates exploratory data analysis, robust preprocessing methods, and hyperparameter tuning to ensure high accuracy and reliability in detecting fraudulent activities.

## Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted detailed data analysis to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships in the dataset. Used visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to interpret trends and anomalies.

## Data Preprocessing:
Implemented robust preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, and data splitting, to prepare the dataset for training.

## Model Development:
Developed a machine learning model using XGBoost, known for its performance and scalability. The model was optimized through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and minimize false positives.

## Noise Testing and Learning Curve Analysis:
Tested the model's robustness by introducing noise in the dataset and analyzing its performance. Evaluated learning curves to understand the model's learning behavior and ensure it generalizes well on unseen data.

## Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Kaggle
## Key Objectives
Detect fraudulent UPI transactions with high precision and recall.
Minimize false positives to reduce unnecessary alerts.
Ensure the model is robust and scalable for real-world applications.
## Results
The project successfully delivered a fraud detection model with high accuracy and reliability. The use of XGBoost ensured the model's efficiency in handling large datasets while providing interpretable results.
